    # { case = range "8.13" "8.14"; out = "1.2.0"; }
    ## other predicates are `isLe v`, `isLt v`, `isGe v`, `isGt v`, `isEq v` etc
  ] null;

  ## Declare existing releases
  ## leave sha256 empty at first and then copy paste
  ## the resulting sha given by the error message
  # release."1.1.1".sha256 = "";
  ## if the tag is not exactly the version number you can amend like this
  # release."1.1.1".rev = "v1.1.1";
  ## if a consistent scheme gives the tag from the release number, you can do like this:
  # releaseRev = v: "v${v}";

  ## Add dependencies in here (declare them first at the begining of the file
  # propagatedBuildInputs = [ ]; ## e.g. `= [ mathcomp coq-elpi ]`

  ## Does the package contain OCaml code?
  # mlPlugin = false;

  ## Give some meta data
  ## This is needed for submitting the package to nixpkgs but not required for local use.
  meta = {
    ## Describe your package in one sentence

    ## Kindly ask one of these people if they want to be an official maintainer.
    ## (You might also consider adding yourself to the list of maintainers)
